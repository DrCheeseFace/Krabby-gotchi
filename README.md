## What is this?
Imagine a future where everyone had a crustacious companion.
<br>
**A world devoid of conflict.**
<br>
I present humbly to thee,

### A Krabby-gotchi ðŸ¦€
(tamagotchi but crab)

## Ok but what really is this?
The krabs made me do it.

## Ok but what *really really* is this?
Learning rust. 
<br>
Hopefully will have a terminal tamagotchi by the end because tamagotchis 
are expensive and crabs are free if you are near an ocean.
